# glommactor
An simple actor framework for the glommio runtime (for learning purposes only)! And someday
maybe other runtimes if the design allows for it.

Heavily inspired by [act-zero](https://www.github.com/Diggsey/act-zero) and Alice Ryhl's
[tokio actors](https://ryhl.io/blog/actors-with-tokio/).
